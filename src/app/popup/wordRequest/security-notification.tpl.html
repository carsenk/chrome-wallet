            Your <vendor-name></vendor-name> may be vulnerable to malware on
            your computer. <vendor-name></vendor-name> uses a seed recovery
            approach that leaks a lot of information about your seed. This
            leaked information can be used by an attacker greatly reduce the
            amount of work required to guess your seed.
        </div>
        <div>
            Because of this vulnerability, your <vendor-name></vendor-name>
            needs to use a longer seed (24 word) to ensure that it remains
            secure after a recovery operation.
        </div>
        <div>
            There is another approach to seed recovery that leaks very little
            information. This approach is supported exclusively by KeepKey. The
            KeepKey recovery method allows it to use a shorter seed (12 words)
            and still maintain a higher level of security.

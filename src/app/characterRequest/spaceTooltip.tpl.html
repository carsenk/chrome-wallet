    The <b>&lt;space&gt;</b> character is used to move to the next word. It is
    only enabled after 3 or 4 characters have been entered for a word.
    NOTE: If your key is longer than 12 words, when you type a <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>
    after the 12th word, space for additional words will be displayed.
